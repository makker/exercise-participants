This project started as a coding test for a job application, but has since evolved to a learning exercise. 

The project has four parts. 

The 'Web' folder includes the React client. Rest of the folders have different versions of the backend REST API.

The 'Aws-api' folder has the serverless backend REST api to DynamoDB. This is the latest version of the API. 

The 'Aws-express-api' folder has a deprecated serverless backend REST done with express. It's based on this tutorial 
https://serverless.com/blog/serverless-express-rest-api/

The third part is deprecated MongoDB REST API on 'Api' folder tested only in local environment. To install MongoDB as required see https://www.codementor.io/olatundegaruba/nodejs-restful-apis-in-10-minutes-q0sgsfhbd
